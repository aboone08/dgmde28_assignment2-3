### Question
Identify an area of JS code in the final solution (ttt5) you feel really good about â€“ and indicate why.


I feel really good about the TicTacToe function because logically, it makes sense to me. In thinking back on the initial assignment where we went through the array and examining the squares in their place from 0 - 8 it definetly makes it easier to see how the squares register where the Xs and Os are placed and therefore can understand what sequence of three in a row would have to be placed to get Tic Tac Toe. 

Although it wasn't asked...I'm having trouble with my reset button. I feel like I got it to work at some point then things got wonky. Or maybe I only was able to reset it how I have it know as resetting only when the game hasn't ended.
